### What is this?

There are a million blogs, tutorials, HOWTOS, and nowadays probably instagram posts or tiktoks or whatever to teach people how to use command-line tools, but I've always found the most effective way to learn is by doing.

The problem with this is that a blank terminal with a blinking cursor is pretty intimidating, and while I had a good ol' time fumbling around for years and years to learn my way around, I understand that that approach doesn't appeal to everybody.

For a while now, I've been wondering whether I could put together an effective set of hands-on tutorials in a git repo that would help folks get comfortable at the command line through a series of step-by-step, hands-on tutorials. I have no idea whether this will accomplish that, but I'm going to give it a try.

If you're new to working from the command-line, or just feel like brushing up, feel free to try the exercises here. If you see something wrong or want to add others, by all means submit a PR! My hope is that this will become a useful resource, but if that doesn't happen I expect I'll at least have some fun.
